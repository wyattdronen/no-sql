# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description
This project creates an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend network. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
The RESTful API supports users and thoughts resources with basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. Users can be created, their profile read, updated, and friends added/removed from their network. Thoughts can be created, read, updated, deleted, and have reactions/comments added/removed.
